# **Project** **Title** **:** Using support vector mechanism  algorithem of suppervis machin learning,predict iris.csv dataset to find out species will be same or different 
# **problem statement:** A American based botnical garden grow iris flower  in ther lab but using bio technology in a singal tree differnt type of variety flower is grow as datascience engineer find out how much aacuracy is ther all categeries contain same specias.
# Task1: preprocess the data in skit.learn library 
# Task2:Load the data using sklearn model selection deffult argument
# Task3: On the baese of your dataset  train test and split your svm model 
# Task4:impliment support vector mechanism clasifier using svm_classifier.The svm must be "Linear"
# Task5:Train the classifier on the training data  
# Task6:findout the prediction value on the test data
# Task7:Testthe model with the help of accuracy,accuracy should lie in range of 0-1

#Conclusion:Accordind to my support vector mechanism model the specias are linear.with the accuracy of 1.00
# Hence proved  model was sussesfully impliment
